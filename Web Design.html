        Choosing attractive color schemes that also enable easy-to-read fonts
        Implementing a brand's identity into the colors, fonts and layout
        Creating a map of the website's structure to ensure intuitive navigation

    ng images, logos, text, videos, applications and other elements
Using coding languages, such as HTML and CSS, to create layouts and to style pages
Making optimized versions of websites and pages both for desktop and mobile viewing
There are two common web design methods: adaptive and responsive design. In adaptive design, the website content is created using standard screen sizes as the frame for the layout.

In responsive design, content moves dynamically according to the screen size. Web designers use the various steps of the general web design process to employ these design methods depending on their client or employer's preferences and goals for the site.
